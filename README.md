# Wheels for OpenWrt

I need some binary wheels for Python software that is not available in OpenWrt and that pip wants to compile using a compiler, so I am building them in an Alpine container.

This is quick and dirty, but works. Possibly it would be possible to achieve this using the OpenWrt SDK instead.
